==> Policy Problems:

- what to do about non-ascii chars in input? They'll fail now, but
  it's a tiny tweak to allow them.
- what about output?
- in general, invalid chars in things such as field-names,
  etc, should be dealt with how?

==> Need to review other APIs

Get code snippets for these actions:

- reading an mbox?
- reading a mime message?
- making a mime message?
- sending a message?
- dealing with invalid chars during read?
- dealing with invalid chars during creation?
- makeing a mmail clone?
- classifying files, text/non-text, mime type?

==> Questions:

- do we support signed and unsigned char types?

==> Base64/Quoted Printable

- example usage
- use buffers, and benchmark
- ownership of streambuf, delete/don't delete

==> SMTP

- do I need an SMTP specific address class?

==> mmail:

- support octet-stream
- need content-disposition
- need encoding
- configuration: /etc/mmail.conf, ~/.mmailrc, $MMAIL

==> header fields:

- content-id
- content-md5
- content-disposition

==> Parsing

- [...]-style addresses, including numbers
- IPv6 addresses
- group-style addresses
- parse domains ending in "."
- parse phrases with unquoted dots
- parse the comment after an address as display-name if not found already
- expand TZ names from those in immhf/date.html

==> Classification and Encoding:

- base64 codec
- qp codec

==> MIME Multipart

- parse
- generate better boundaries
- test against multiparts inside multiparts

==> Mailbox

- mbox reader

==> Release

- rename 'mail' to 'mmail'
- mmail and maildump in seperate directories
- Linux build
- Doxygen doc generation
- collect relevant rfcs and other docs
